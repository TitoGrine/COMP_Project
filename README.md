## COMP Project

Project of COMP (Compilers - 3rd year of Integrated Master Degree in Computer Engineering).
The goal of the project was to build a compiler for a simple language called Java--, capable of translating programs in this language to java bytecodes. This included building a parser for the grammar, for lexical and syntatic analysis, and later converting it into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) to allow for semantic analysis. Finally the code was converted into JVM instructions accepted by [Jasmin](http://jasmin.sourceforge.net/) utilising various compiler optimizations. The generated code was able to be compiled with javac and could be run with java.
